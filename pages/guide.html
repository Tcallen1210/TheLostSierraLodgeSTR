Who We Are

Hi there! We’re Travis and Brittany Allen, your hosts here at Lost Sierra Lodge. Travis’s family has called Plumas County home for generations and he grew up in this beautiful house that his parents built themselves in the early '90s. In this guidebook, we’ve shared some of our favorite local spots and activities that we think you’ll love during your stay. We've also left some fun historical pictures and tidbits about the area throughout the house for you to enjoy.

While most of the Allen family still lives nearby, we currently call Eastern Nevada home, where we both work as wildlife biologists. But don’t worry—we’re always just a phone call away during your stay and our family is right down the road in case you need any personal assistance. There may be times when we're out of cell service while working (parts of Nevada are even more remote than here!), but we'll make sure your messages automatically go to another family member who can help.

We’re truly grateful that you’re supporting our small, family-owned business, and we’re excited to share our home and community with you. The Lost Sierra is a very special place where time slows down, roots run deep, and natural beauty is in abundance. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

What is the "Lost Sierra?"

The "Lost Sierra" refers to a rugged and relatively untouched region in the northern Sierra Nevada of California and is known for its dense forests, mountain peaks, pristine lakes, and small historic towns. The term "Lost Sierra" was coined and made popular by ski historian William Blakely in his book Lost Sierra; Gold, Ghosts & Skis and reflects its remote, somewhat off-the-beaten-path character, with a rich history that includes Native American heritage and mining days from the Gold Rush era. The region offers a haven for outdoor activities like hiking, camping, fishing, and skiing, and it is often considered a hidden gem for those seeking to explore nature away from more crowded tourist destinations.

"Set amid beautiful mountain peaks and charming towns, the Lost Sierra is considered the geography within Sierra and Plumas Counties in California. Home to Graeagle, Portola, Quincy, Lake Almanor, Greenville, and Chester, as well as dozens of smaller towns – Loyalton, Downieville, Sierraville, and more – and picturesque areas, all peppered with parks, trails, and waterways ready for exploration." - DiscovertheLostSierra.com

              <p class="guide-content">
General Directions

The easiest way to get directions is by clicking this link to Google Maps: Directions to The Lost Sierra Lodge. You'll also find the MAP option in the menu at the bottom of your screen. Once on the map you'll see a blue house icon bouncing into position - this is where you are staying! Simply click the icon and then click "get directions". It will open Google Maps and our address will be filled in. You simply need to type in your starting point.

The Lost Sierra Lodge is a quick 4 miles west of Portola right off CA-70 and is only accessible by driving. Coming from the northeast/east (Alturas/Reno), the fastest way is to take CA-70 W from US-395. Coming from the southwest/west (Sacramento or the Bay Area), the fastest way is to go through Truckee and take CA-89 to CA-70 W. Coming from the northwest/west (Redding/Oroville), you'll want to take CA-70 E through Quincy. You can find more detailed directions in the following sections.

Please be sure to check road conditions before you leave in case of any road closures or detours.

From Reno: ~53 miles, ~1 hour drive time

Head north on US-395 N toward Susanville for 24 miles, then take the CA-70 exit ramp at Hallelujah Junction and turn left toward Portola/Quincy. Stay on CA-70 W for 28 miles, passing through Portola. Once you see the Chalet View Lodge on your left, your turn off the highway onto a dirt road will be immediately past the Chalet View Lodge on your right. This road will be unmarked from the highway but Google Maps calls it Caricoo Court Trail. Please drive slowly (10 mph) on this road to be considerate of our neighbors and to prevent unnecessary damage. Follow Caricoo Court Trail for 0.2 miles until you come to a fork and stay right at the fork to go up the little hill onto Jamie Way. The Lost Sierra Lodge will be the first house on the right. Please park in the paved driveway directly in front of the house.

From Truckee: ~52 miles, ~1 hour drive time

Head north on CA-89/S Lincoln St toward Sierraville for 23 miles. Turn left onto CA-49 S/CA-89N/S Lincoln St/W Main St (signs for Quincy/Downieville). After 4 miles, turn right onto Westside Rd and follow for 15 miles until you get to CA-70 W. Turn left onto CA-70 W and follow 8.4 miles, passing through Portola. Once you see the Chalet View Lodge on your left, your turn off the highway onto a dirt road will be immediately past the Chalet View Lodge on your right. This road will be unmarked from the highway but Google Maps calls it Caricoo Court Trail. Please drive slowly (10 mph) on this road to be considerate of our neighbors and to prevent unnecessary damage.

Please park in the paved driveway directly in front of the house.

From Oroville: ~106 miles, ~2 hours 11 mins driving time

Take State Hwy 70 N for 5.6 miles. At the interchange Wick's Corner, use the right lanes to follow signs for CA-70 N toward Paradise/Quincy/US-191 and follow for 99 miles, passing through Quincy. Once you see the Feather River RV Park on your right, the turn off the highway will be about a half-mile further on your left (if you see the Chalet View Lodge on your right you've gone too far). This road will be unmarked from the highway but Google Maps calls it Caricoo Court Trail. Please drive slowly (10 mph) on this road to be considerate of our neighbors and to prevent unnecessary damage.

Terroir Bar (pronounced ter-war) is an experienced and local bartending service, providing in-house bartending with fresh squeezed juices, homemade syrups, and quality ingredients.

Kitchen Appliance Tips

All of the devices here should be pretty easy to use, but here are a few specifics you might find helpful:

Dishwasher

Dishwasher detergent and rinse aid are stored under the kitchen sink—just pop one detergent pod in per load and make sure the rinse aid bubble in the detergent holder is still blue before starting a load.
The cycle controls are located on top of the door. To start a load, select your cycle options while the door is open, then close it, and the dishwasher will begin automatically!

Coffee (USER MANUAL)

For coffee lovers, we have a 12-cup and single-cup combo machine, so you can brew just a cup for yourself or enough for the whole group!
Detailed instructions on how to use the coffee maker are inside the top left cabinet where the coffee mugs are stored.

Stove & Range Top

The electric range top is made of glass, so please be careful when setting items down to avoid cracking the surface.
To turn the electric range burners, pinch the knobs then twist to your desired heat level.
If the oven is on, please be sure to leave the vents at the edge of the glass top uncovered.

Air Fryer & Toaster Oven

Instructions for how to use the air fryer settings are posted on the side of the fridge right next to the air fryer.
The air fryer and toaster oven can be used as two separate chambers at once, or as a single larger chamber for larger items.
The air fryer’s trays, implements, and manual are in the drawer under the oven.
If the control knob is blue, the oven is not generating heat. If it is red, the oven is on and generating heat.

Heating & Cooling

We’re lucky to be in a spot where the fresh mountain air takes care of our air conditioning during the summer. If the house starts to warm up, just open the windows once the sun goes down and let the cool breeze and pine-scented air help you chill out. If the temperature drops below 65°F the furnace will kick on to warm things up, so either close the living room windows or turn the thermostat down before you go to bed. To keep bugs (and curious wildlife!) out, please only leave the windows open. Since the doors don’t have screens, it’s best to keep them closed to avoid any unexpected visitors. Thanks for helping us keep things comfy!

If you’re feeling a little chilly and want to warm things up, you can adjust the thermostat in the living room next to the poker table. We’ve got an EcoBee thermostat that’s connected to WiFi, and if you’re having any issues with it, just let us know—we can adjust the settings remotely to help you out! To help keep energy costs down, we kindly ask that you don't set the thermostat above 75°F. Thanks so much for your help in keeping things efficient and comfortable!

Laundry Appliances

The washing machine and dryer are located downstairs, near the kitchen and dining room. We’ve provided hypoallergenic laundry detergent and fabric softener sheets for your convenience.

To use the washing machine, simply turn it on to unlock the door. After adding your laundry and detergent, close the door, choose your preferred cycle, and hit the start button.

For the dryer, load your freshly washed clothes and a dryer sheet (if you'd like), then make sure the lint screen is clean. Close the door, select your cycle, and press start. Just a heads up - the "steam" function won’t work since there's no water hose connected to the dryer. If you need to de-wrinkle your clothes, you can find an iron and ironing board in the master bedroom closet.

If you’re unsure about anything, you’ll find detailed instructions in the drawer by the computer nook near the dining table. Let us know if you need any help!

Hang Out Under the Pines

The outdoor patio is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the fresh air under the pine trees! Fire up the grill for a delicious BBQ, or cozy up around the fire pit as the evening cools down—there’s plenty of seating with comfy chairs and tables for everyone to gather around. If you're in the mood to unwind, the hot tub is ready to help you relax under the stars, just be sure to bring your own towel!

For some outdoor fun, you'll find disc golf baskets just off the patio, offering a great way to enjoy some friendly competition under the tall trees. Whether you're grilling, playing games, or just soaking in the peaceful atmosphere, the patio and its surrounding area have something for everyone to enjoy!

After enjoying your outdoor hangs, please be sure to clean up any food scraps and trash to avoid any unwanted visits from the local wildlife. We want to keep both you and the wildlife safe and happy!

Designated Smoking Areas

We kindly ask that you use one of our designated outdoor smoking areas, clearly labeled with ashtrays and cigarette receptacles:

The back deck by the fire pit
The front porch at the table

Please be sure to close all windows and doors while smoking to keep the indoor air fresh. Use the provided ashtrays for all ash and embers, and place all trash in the designated receptacles. With dry pine needles around, fire safety is especially important.

Thanks for helping us keep the space safe and comfortable for everyone!

House Water

The Lost Sierra Lodge is on a well and is not attached to the municipal water system. This area naturally has high iron and calcium in it's water, but we've made sure to install a state of the art water filtering system to ensure that these natural elements are removed from the well water before it comes through the house for your enjoyment. There's an additional container of extra filtered drinking water in the refrigerator if you prefer to use it.

To keep the filtration system running smoothly, it’s set to flush every day at 3 AM. This process helps clear any built-up sediment and takes about 15 minutes to complete. During this time, you may notice a slight drop in water pressure, but rest assured, it's a necessary part of maintaining clean, fresh water throughout the house.

Naturally, as the house is on a well the water pressure might be lower than you may be used to.

If you ever have questions about the water please reach out.

Accidental Damage or Breaks

We totally understand that accidents happen! If something gets damaged or broken please let us know immediately so we can get it taken care of and make sure the next guest isn't affected. Don't worry, we have systems in place to cover both you and us for the replacement costs, but we do need to submit photos of the damaged items for coverage.

It would be super helpful if you could please email us pictures of the damaged item following the guidelines below at Vacation@thelostsierralodge.com. And please don't discard the damaged item, just place it somewhere out of the way (like the laundry room or master closet) and let us know where you've put it.

At least 3 photos for each damaged item:

Close-up of the damage for each item
A shot showing the whole item
Photos and/or description of tag/sticker with brand/model, if applicable

Tips for Documenting Damage:

Take photos from a few different angles: Along with close-ups, take some shots from a few feet away to show the damaged item in context and overall quality of the item. This is especially important for larger items or damage that spans a larger area.
Make sure the lighting is good: Ensure the damaged area is well-lit so details are clearly visible in the photos. Avoid using a flash if it creates a glare or reflection that obscures the damage.

Thanks so much for your help with this! If you have any questions, just let us know!

Bears

Resident bears are usually harmless and tend to stay out of sight during the day. However, if they catch a whiff of food scraps or trash left outside at night, they might stop by to check things out, so it’s important to clean up all food and trash from outdoor areas and vehicles before heading inside for the evening.

If you need to take trash bags out during your stay, please use the designated bear box in the front yard to keep things safe and secure. Thanks for helping keep everyone (including the bears!) safe!

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We enjoyed our stay! There may have been a some minor inconveniences, but an overall great experience!

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Good experience. There were some issues that were not addressed. Communication was okay but mostly subpar.

⭐️⭐️⭐️ Just okay experience. Many issues with the property, poor communication with little resolve, and I would not recommend to anyone.

⭐️⭐️ Bad experience. Significant issues with the property and no communication from the host. This property should be removed from booking platforms.

⭐️ Terrible experience. The property is awful, the experience was terrible.
